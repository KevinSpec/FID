<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <dfn>extremely</dfn> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In <dfn>sous vide</dfn> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <dfn>Cooking for Geeks</dfn>, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><dfn>Sous Vide</dfn> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
